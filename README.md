# 🤖 FinSolve Role-Based Chatbot

A secure, intelligent chatbot powered by **LLMs + Vector Search (RAG)** — with **role-based access control (RBAC)** for Finance, HR, Engineering, Marketing, Employees, and C-Level Executives.

---

## 🧩 Problem Background

**FinSolve Technologies**,  a leading FinTech company, was experiencing communication delays and fragmented document access across teams like Finance, HR, Marketing, Engineering, and C-Level Executives. These issues led to slower decision-making and operational inefficiencies, as teams lacked a centralized, secure way to access internal knowledge specific to their roles.

---

## 🧠 Solution Overview
To address this issue, an internal AI chatbot was developed using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). It ensures that every user receives accurate, secure, and role-relevant information instantly.

This chatbot solves FinSolve's data access problem using:
- 🧠 **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** via LLaMA 3 (Ollama)
- 🔐 **Role-Based Filtering** at the vector search level
- ⚡ **FastAPI + Streamlit** for interactive chat and login
- 🧾 **Documents** stored per department with metadata

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sakshcc/role_based_aichatbot
cd role-based-chatbot
```

#### 2. 🔧 Backend Setup (FastAPI + LLaMA 3 via Ollama)

Step into the backend app and create a virtual environment:

```bash
cd app
python -m venv venv
````

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
# OR
source venv/bin/activate  # On Mac/Linux
````

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r ../requirements.txt
```

In a new terminal, start the LLaMA 3 model using Ollama:

```bash
ollama run llama3
```
📝 Keep this terminal open — it runs the local LLM engine.
The first run will download the model (~3–4 GB).

Go back to the backend terminal and start the FastAPI server:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### 3. 💬 Frontend Setup (Streamlit UI)
In another new terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
streamlit run frontend.py
```
🔗 Visit: http://localhost:8501

### 4. 📄 Embed Documents (Run Once Before Use)
To embed documents into ChromaDB:

```bash
python embed_documents.py
```

This script:
Loads documents from the data/ folder
Generates embeddings using sentence-transformers
Stores them in ChromaDB with role-based metadata

✅ Once these steps are done, your role-based chatbot is fully set up and ready to use!
